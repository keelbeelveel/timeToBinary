# timeToBinary.py

A simple script which quizzes the user on their ability to convert the time from binary to decimal. I wrote this code in the early planning stages of my Binary Clock project in order to determine if I would be able to comfortably read the time off of the clock in Binary before I went forward with the design. Enjoy!
